#Battleship game
This is a commandline game.

Top left is A1.

Its 10 x 10 board, where ships are placed horizontally or vertically. user enters coordinate of ship and fires, if it hits, then display HIT. If all positions of ship is hit, show SINK.

If user enters 'I LOSE', then print the board.
Else, keep on with the game.

There are 4 kinds of ships:-
 - Carrier - size 5
 - Battleship - size 4
 - Submarine - size 3
 - Patrol - size 2

Ships randomly appear on board, and they should'nt overlap as well.

I think I have pretty much explained everything.
